#Singleton Pattern: Database Connection Example

##Description
This project demonstrates the Singleton design pattern by implementing a class responsible for managing a database connection. The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the DataBaseConnection class is created and provides a global point of access to that instance. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a single database connection is required throughout the application to avoid resource wastage and ensure consistent access.

##Features
-Single Instance: Ensures only one instance of the database connection exists.
-Centralized Management: Provides a global point of access to the database connection.
-Connection Handling: Includes methods to create, retrieve, and close the database connection.
##Use Case
In applications where multiple parts need to access the database, managing a single connection instance prevents the overhead and potential issues associated with multiple connections. By using the Singleton pattern, you ensure that all database operations are performed through a single, consistent connection.
