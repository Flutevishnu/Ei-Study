# Singleton Pattern: Database Connection Example

## Description
This project demonstrates the Singleton design pattern by implementing a class responsible for managing a database connection. The Singleton pattern ensures that only one instance of the DataBaseConnection class is created and provides a global access point to that instance. This is particularly useful in scenarios where a single database connection is required throughout the application to avoid resource wastage and ensure consistent access.

## Features
-Single Instance: Ensures only one instance of the database connection exists.
-Centralized Management: Provides a global access point to the database connection.
-Connection Handling: Includes methods to create, retrieve, and close the database connection.
## Use Case
Managing a single connection instance prevents the overhead and potential issues associated with multiple connections in applications where multiple parts need to access the database. By using the Singleton pattern, you ensure that all database operations are performed through a single, consistent connection.
