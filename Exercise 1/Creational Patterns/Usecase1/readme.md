# Payment Processor with Factory Method
## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Factory Method design pattern in a payment processing system. 
It includes support for two payment methods: Credit Card and PayPal. 
The Factory Method pattern provides a way to encapsulate the instantiation of objects, allowing the client code to work with a factory interface rather than concrete implementations.

## Design Patterns Used
Factory Method Pattern: Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. 
This helps in decoupling the client code from the specific classes that implement the payment processing.
