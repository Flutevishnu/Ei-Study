# Payment Processor with Factory Method
## Description
The Payment Processor is a flexible and extensible system designed to handle payments via multiple methods using the Factory Method design pattern. This implementation includes support for processing payments through Credit Card and PayPal. The Factory Method pattern allows for the creation of payment processing objects without specifying their concrete classes, promoting scalability and ease of maintenance.

## Features
Flexible Payment Handling: Supports multiple payment methods including Credit Card and PayPal.
Factory Method Design Pattern: Decouples the creation of payment processing objects from their usage.
Extensible Architecture: Easily extend the system to include additional payment methods.
Seamless Integration: Integrate with different payment gateways with minimal code changes.
Secure Transactions: Ensures secure processing of payment information.


## Usecases
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Factory Method design pattern in a payment processing system. 
It includes support for two payment methods: Credit Card and PayPal. 
The Factory Method pattern provides a way to encapsulate the instantiation of objects, allowing the client code to work with a factory interface rather than concrete implementations.
