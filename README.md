### Exercise 2: Real-Time Chat Application
This Real-Time Chat Application is a console-based chat system developed in TypeScript, designed to facilitate real-time communication between users. It supports both public chat rooms and private messaging features. Users can create or join chat rooms, send and receive messages in real-time, and even communicate privately with another user.
